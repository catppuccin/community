| WELL DONE EVERYONE                   | Hamothy   | • You guys are awesome                                                                                                                                                      |
| The 'Licensing Issue'                | winston   | • Some of our repos aren't always MIT licensed, how do we wanna deal with this? <br>• Relevant context: [KDE Comment](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/issues/1719) |
| The 'Ownership Issue'                | lemon     | • Some of our ports credit a single person as the author, some multiple, and some the org. As briefly mentioned before; I think that should be unified. We might need to make a plan on this. |
| On-boarding / Port Transfer Workflow | winston   | • The current process is slightly undefined now, a GitHub bot would be great. <br> However, the question is what should the bot do?                                         |
| Christmas Stuffs :D                  | Isabel    | • We should do lots of things for Christmas! <br>• Wallpapers? Cursors? Icons/Banners? Renamed Roles?                                                                       |
| Merch (Again!)                       | Hamothy   | • So we got rejected from Fourthwall (sadge) <br>• How do we want to proceed? Sticker Mule?                                                                                 |
| Open Collective Monies               | Hamothy   | • Linked to the previous item above ^ We should really make plans / budget with the support that we're getting!                                                             |
| Future Roadmap                       | Hamothy   | • What do we want to get accomplished by the end of the year 2022? (no solid deadlines or timelines but a general sense of direction :D)                                    |
