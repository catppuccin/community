## Discussion

- Last year, too inexperienced to contribute to open source projects
- This year, would be pretty cool to collaborate 
- Events throughout october, once a week (get together and chat about things we worked on), things we worked on. 
- Post VODs on Youtube (bigger scale, "events") more people in a room (let's all hang out and code together)
- NB: Bashbunni not allowed to stream on multiple accounts
- Making it easier for contributors to contribute, if we want to stream our first chat, talk about specific issues and different directions 

## Concrete Ideas

- Weekly / Biweekly discussions on stream (podcast-style)
- Create some `good-first-issue`'s to tackle for everyone to collaborate on and encourage newcomers to contribute
- Create a HacktoberFest 2022 section on the discord with a public voice chat to encourage people to collaborate together

### Podcast Topics

**Week 1**: Bashbunni w/ Catppuccin & Co - The State of Catppuccin  
- The state of automation in Catppuccin, getting more familiar with command line tools like `jq`, `yq` etc. 
- Build steps in some repositories can be improved, still unfortunately a lot of hardcoded values. (An example is the [aliucord](https://github.com/catppuccin/aliucord) repository)
- Repositories that still need to get ported to Catppuccin v2 Palette
- The future of Catppuccin! (possibly new dev tools like `catppuccin/lint` which would always ensure that the correct colours are used)
- New website, gaining more of a social media presence, etc

**Week 2**: Contributing to Open Source w/ Catppuccin!
- Catppuccin people can offer different perspectives in their journey into open source
- What was difficult? How to gain the confidence to message and own a piece of work? Healthy open source habits!

**Week 3**: IDK :LUL:

**Week 4**: IDK :LUL:

(Worth mentioning that Bash's Timeslot will usually be: 9am PST to 2pm PST)
